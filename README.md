# Car-Arrival-Simulator
The car wash center has three wash bays, each with different service times. Cars arrive randomly and form a single queue. When a wash bay becomes available, the next car in line proceeds to that bay. The service time required by each car and the inter-arrival time between cars are generated randomly.
